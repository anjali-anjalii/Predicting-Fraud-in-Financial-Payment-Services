# Predicting-Fraud-in-Financial-Payment-Services
In digital age we know that financial fraud is a great threat for individuals as well as institutions. To combat this challenge we need datasets but this type of datasets are rare to find. The one we are using here is one of only four datasets present on kaggle. This data gives us an opportunity to find an effective method for the financial fraud detection. But there are some challenges, the data is highly imbalanced. So, the main goal here is to resolve the issues by detailed data exploration and to develop a practical solution for identifying fraud, and make digital finance more secured and safe.
